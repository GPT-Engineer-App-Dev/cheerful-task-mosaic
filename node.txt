Node.js: The JavaScript Runtime

Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side, enabling the creation of scalable and efficient network applications.

Key features of Node.js:
1. Asynchronous and Event-Driven
2. Single-Threaded but Highly Scalable
3. Cross-Platform
4. Large Ecosystem (npm)
5. Fast Execution

Node.js is widely used for building web servers, real-time applications, command-line tools, and more. Its non-blocking I/O model makes it an excellent choice for developing high-performance, data-intensive applications.
